## How it works

## Installation

You can pick the latest release for each supported platforms (Windows/MacOS/Linux)
on the [Github's releases page](https://github.com/jbltx/rlauncher/releases).

> As the application is using SSH protocol to communicate between Scheduler and Agents, please make sure to generate and share **RSA** **certificates** across your nodes for security purposes. You can use `ssh-keygen -t rsa` command for this.

 1. Install the agent service on all slave nodes you want to use to run processes.
    ```sh
    sudo rLauncher agent install
    sudo rLauncher agent start
    ```
 2. On the master node, you run the application without options
    ```sh
    rLauncher
    ```
    This will launch the terminal-based user-interface.

### Available *Scheduler* commands
 * **list** : Print a list of available agents from discovery.

### Available *Agent* commands

 * **install** : Install the Agent OS-specific service.
 * **uninstall** : Uninstall the service.
 * **start** : Start the service, if needed.
 * **stop** : Stop the service, if needed.
 * **run** : Special command to run the agent directly without installing
 a service. Please be aware it will cause conflict if the service is listening in background on same ports as the run command.
   * `--no-discovery` : will run without discovery services.
   * `--port <p>` : define a port to listen to (default: 22000).
